Components- let you split UI into independent, reusable pieces and work with them in isolation
function Components- (LITERALLY A JS FUNCTION) write a function in JS, it is valid cause it accepts "props"
class Components- less common now, use Hooks part of the state and lifecycle fun comps make up the larger class comp
props- properties, the object argument with data that returns the react element
hooks- lets you use state and other React features without writing class


if you were going to make react, needs a:
    JS file where react is writen
    an HTML where the script is encapsulated 
whats the difference between react elements and components?
    in order to build your UI, you need a bunch of components, that you then compose together   
    a component is a function (or class) that optionally accepts input and returns a react element
    so basically you make these

state- data within the app
props- information you pass a component
