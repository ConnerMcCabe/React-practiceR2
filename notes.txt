Components- let you split UI into independent, reusable pieces and work with them in isolation
function Components- (LITERALLY A JS FUNCTION) write a function in JS, it is valid cause it accepts "props"
class Components- less common now, use Hooks part of the state and lifecycle fun comps make up the larger class comp
props- properties, the object argument with data that returns the react element
hooks- lets you use state and other React features without writing class


if you were going to make react, needs a:
    JS file where react is writen
    an HTML where the script is encapsulated 
whats the difference between react elements and components?
    a component is a function (or class) that optionally accepts input and returns a react element
    so basically function components return an element, which is just JS that will be 
    returned and transpired by Babel to resemble HTML and in order to build your UI, you need a bunch of components
    that you then compose together   
    
state- data within the app
props- information you pass a component
